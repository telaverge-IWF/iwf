 *
 * Description: The WorkItem Sample Application illustrates the creation and 
 *              usage of the WorkItem and WorkItemPool and the related 
 *              functions.

 * Usage:       The WorkItemPool is created using the C Function  
 *              
 *              WORKITEMPOOL *tmpinst = WORKITEMPOOL_InitPool( void *data,
 *                                      50001, 4, 0, WORKITEMPOOL_Dispatch)
 *
 *              This function creates a WorkItemPool, that internally creates
 *              a WorkItem Queue with instance 50001.
 *
 *              The desired number of WorkItems can be created and added to the 
 *              Pool using the function
 *               
 *              WORKITEM_Instance *item = WORKITEM_Create( 12, false, App_func)     
 *               
 *              This function would create a WorkItem with size 12, nonpersistent 
 *              and points to the func App_func. If the WorkItem is made persistent,
 *              the event would return to the queue. This function returns a 
 *              pointer to the allocated WorkItem.
 *              Once the WorkItem has been created, the event to be placed in the 
 *              Queue has to be assigned to the object pointed to by the Instance
 *              returned by WorkItem.
 *               .....
 *              item->object = evt;
 *
 *              Now the WorkItem (i.e, the event) has to be added to the Pool and 
 *              thus placed on the Queue created by the Pool. The WorkItemPool gets
 *              the event from the queue and dispatches that the event to one of the 
 *              available threads in the Pool. 
 *            
 *              WORKITEM_PutWorkItem(TRANSPORT_INSTANCE(WORKITEMPOOL_QUEUE(tmpinst)),
 *                                                                             item)
 *              The arguments for this function is the Instance of the Queue created 
 *              by the Pool and the pointer to the WorkItem.
 *
