Preface
-------
This document describes how to build the SSLRef 3.0 test application,
providing an example of how SSLRef 3.0 can be built as part of your
software project. It includes these sections:

  - Building SSLRef 3.0
  - Using the Sample Certificate
  - Running the Test Application


Building SSLRef 3.0
-------------------
First, install the cryptographic library of your choice (RSAREF or
BSAFE).

Place BSAFE in a directory called bsafe/. The bsafe/ directory
should contain the BSAFE directories LIB, INCLUDE, etc. If you are
using RSAREF, place RSAREF in a directory called rsaref/ within the
sslref/ directory. This directory should contain all the RSAREF
source files (not the documentation directory, etc.).

For Windows, you should be ready to build. Type
    nmake /f makefile.w32 CRYPTOLIB=BSAFE
 or nmake /f makefile.w32 CRYPTOLIB=RSAREF, as appropriate.

This will build the sample client/server app, "sslsampl". The target
sslref.lib also works to build only the sslref library.

You can also specify where to find RSAREF or BSAFE with a flag on the
make command line of the form RSAREFDIR=path or BSAFEDIR=path.

For Solaris, there are different targets for the BSAFE and RSAREF
versions of the library and sample application. Enter either:
    make -f makefile.solaris sslsampl-bsafe
 or make -f makefile.solaris sslsampl-rsaref

For Solaris, you cannot specify the location of your crypto library on
the command line. You must either edit the make file or create an
appropriate directory link to the source directory where RSAREF or
BSAFE are stored.

Because RSAREF does not include the RC4 algorithm, it must be provided
seperately in order to support RC4 CipherSuites with RSAREF. This
algorithm is interfaced in the file sslrc4.c.

If you create your own make files or modify the ones supplied you must
pass compile-time flags to the C compiler. To choose between RSAREF and
BSAFE, specify a non-zero value for the compile-time flag RSAREF or
BSAFE. Specify a value for the compile-time flag DEBUG between 0 and 5
to activate expanded diagnostic output.

To function as a server or with client certification, SSLRef 3.0
requires two files:
  certchain - contains a certificate chain in the following format:
    For each certificate:
      3 byte length
      DER-encoded certificate
  privateKey - is a PKCS-7 encoded private key.

The private key filename and password are hard-coded into
sample/testssl.c.


Using the Sample Certificate
----------------------------
To function as a server or with client authentication, the sample
application requires a certificate file including all certificates
associated with that keypair. (The sample application's certificate
file mechanism is an example of how certificates and keys can be
stored. It is not a requirement of SSLRef. You may implement a
different storage mechanism.)

We have included a sample certificate file in /test.crt with the key
in /private.key; the password for this certificate file is
"password". The sample certificate file /test.crt must reside in the
same directory as the make files. You are welcome to replace this
certificate file with your own.

The name of the signer file, and the password for encrypted private
key are hard-coded into sample/testssl.c.

Certificate files will typically include multiple certificates to
form a "certificate chain". The order within the file is server cert
to root cert and must not be changed.

This certificate in the /test.crt file contains a test certificate.
This test certificate was issued under a test CA (certificate
authority) built using an alpha version of Consensus Development's
Cert Plus toolkit. This certificate will, in time, expire.
Consensus will continue to provide valid revisions to the SSLRef
certificate available from its web site, <http://www.consensus.com>

If you use this sample certificate file with Netscape Navigator or a
Netscape server you will be warned that the certificate is not from
a "known" certificate authority.

To minimize these warnings, you can add the Consensus Development
test heirarchy root certificate to Netscape Navigator by going to
page
    <http://www.consensus.com/certplus/ConsensusDevelopmentTestCA.cert>

and approving the addition of this test CA to your site certificate
database.

With this test CA installed you can use Navigator to establish server
authentication with the SSLRef test application. You can view or
delete this test CA in the "Site Certificates" section "Security
Preferences" of the Navigator.

You can also add the test CA the Netscape Server using the
instructions located at
    <http://home.netscape.com/eng/security/downloadcert.html#server>

and entering the following certificate into the server admin pages:

-----END CERTIFICATE-----

With this test CA installed you can use SSLRef to establish client
authentication with a Netscape Server. You can view and delete this test
CA from the server admin pages.


Running the Test Application
----------------------------
The SSL test client takes these command line options
  -s  act as server
  -c  act as client
  -2  support only SSL2
  -3  support only SSL3 <hostname> <port#>
