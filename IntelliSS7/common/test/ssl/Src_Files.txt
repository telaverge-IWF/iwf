The contents of the doc folder are described in About_Docs.txt, located
in the doc folder.


The src folder contains:

    asn1oids.c       a table of ASN.1 object IDs
    asn1util.c       utilities for parsing ASN.1 DER

    ciphers.c        a table mapping cipherSpecs to ciphers, MAC
                     algorithms, key exchange, and similar items

    digests.c        generalized hash interface functions for MD5
                     and SHA1 and a dummy null hash implementation

    hdskcert.c       support for the handshake certificate message
    hdskchgc.c       support for change cipher spec messages
    hdskfini.c       support for finished and server hello done messages
    hdskhelo.c       support for client hello and server hello messages
    hdskkeys.c       support for master secret & key calculation and
                     resultant initialization of the ciphers
    hdskkyex.c       support for key exchange and server key exchange
                     messages

    nullciph.c       a dummy implementation of the null cipher

    ssl2map.c        an array that maps SSL 2 cipher kinds to SSL 3
                     cipher suites
    ssl2mesg.c       message encoding and decoding functions for SSL 2
    ssl2prot.c       protocol engine for SSL 2
    ssl2rec.c        record encrypting/decrypting for SSL 2

    sslalert.c       support for alert protocol in SSL 3
    sslalloc.c       generalized allocation through user callbacks
    sslctx.c         initializing and configuring SSLContext structures
    ssldebug.c       simple message printing and data dumping
    sslhdshk.c       the handshake state machine
    sslrc4.c         interface code to RC4 in BSAFE and RSAREF
    sslrec.c         the record layer, including encryption and MACing
                     of data
    sslsess.c        support for resumable sessions using callbacks
    ssltrspt.c       a layer which handles moving data between the
                     application, record layer, and protocol advancement
    sslutil.c        utility functions for encoding structures

    x509.c           support for X.509 DER certificates

The header names in the include folder should be fairly obvious. Most of
the files are associated with a particular source file or set of source
files. Of specific note:

    cryptype.h       data types associated with cryptographic
                     capabilities including hashes, symmetric ciphers
                     and cipher specs

    ssl.h            probably the only file an user will have to
                     include directly

    sslctx.h         the declaration of the SSLContext structure

    sslerrs.h        errors SSLRef 3.0 can return


The sample software consists of code that is outside the SSLRef 3.0
library itself, but provides an example of how SSLRef 3.0 might be used.
The sample folder contains:

    dhprimes.c       predefined Diffie-Hellman groups
    privkey.c        PKCS 5 and PCKS 7 for private key encoding

    testdb.c         database support for resumable sessions
    testdb.h         prototypes for TestDB

    testio.c         I/O callbacks for TestSSL

    testssl.c        A unix program to demonstrate SSLRef 3.0
    testssl.h        prototypes for TestSSL

    testutil.c       callback functions for system functionality
                     including allocation, random, and time.

    verisign.c       VeriSign root certificate data
