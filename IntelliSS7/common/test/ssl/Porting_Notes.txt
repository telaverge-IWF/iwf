Porting Notes
-------------
SSLRef was written to be in simple and portable ANSI C. Wherever
possible, platform-specific functionality was segregated into callback
functions which can be provided by the user of the library. SSLRef is
not dependant on any particular network layer or memory allocation
scheme. SSLRef makes calls to these library functions:

  - various cryptographic functionality provided by RSAREF or BSAFE
  - memcpy()
  - memcmp()
  - memset()
  - fprintf() - Only when the compile-time macro DEBUG is given a value
                greater than zero. Used only in ssldebug.c

Capabilities provided by the user include:
  - Memory allocation
  - Network access
  - The current time in seconds since 1/1/1970

The only other known portability issue is the size of size-dependant
variables: in ssl.h these lines appear:

   typedef unsigned char       uint8;
   typedef unsigned short      uint16;
   typedef unsigned long       uint32;
   typedef signed long         sint32;

Should your platform define the char, short, or long types with lengths
different from these, the types should be adjusted to match the expected
lengths.

SSLRef should require no changes to compile on platforms of different
endian-ness.
