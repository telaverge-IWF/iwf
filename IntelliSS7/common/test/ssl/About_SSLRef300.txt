Preface
-------
This document provides an overview of the SSLRef 3.0 package. It also
describes how to quickly begin using SSLRef 3.0. The document contains
these sections:

  - What is SSLRef 3.0

  - SSLRef 3.0 License Restrictions
  - Getting More Information About SSLRef 3.0


What is SSLRef 3.0
------------------
SSLRef 3.0 is a reference implementation of the SSL (Secure Sockets
Layer) protocol. It conforms to version 3.0 of the SSL specification
available at:

    <http://home.netscape.com/eng/ssl3/index.html>

SSLRef 3.0 is intended to aid and accelerate developers' efforts to
provide security within TCP/IP applications. It can also be used to
qualify other version 3.0 implementations of the SSL protocol.

SSLRef 3.0 consists of a software library distributed as ANSI C
source-code that can be compiled on Windows 95/NT and on the Solaris
platforms, and then linked into TCP/IP application programs. SSLRef
3.0 also was designed to be easily portable to a wide variety of
other platforms and operating systems.

SSLRef 3.0 was codeveloped by Netscape Communications Corp. of Mountain
View, California <http://home.netscape.com/> and Consensus Development
Corporation of Berkeley, California <http://www.consensus.com/>.


Getting Started with SSLRef 3.0
-------------------------------
The SSLRef package contains many files describing various aspects of the
implementation.  Fortunately not everyone must read every file. Rather,
you can focus on the files that provide the information in which you are
interested.

You can find more information about the documentation files of SSLRef
3.0 by reading About_Docs.txt.

If you are an impatient programer and just want to see how the API
looks, review

  - ssl.h
  - API_Details.pdf

If you are adding SSL 3.0 support to an application on one of the
directly supported platforms, you also should read

  - Src_Files.txt
  - API_Introduction.txt
  - Build_Notes.txt
  - Implementation_Notes.txt

If you are adding SSL 3.0 support to an application currently using
SSLRef 2.0, you should also read

  - SSLRef_2_to_3.txt

If you are adding SSL 3.0 support to an application on a platform not
directly supported by SSLRef 3.0, you will have to port SSLRef to that
platform. To learn about the few issues related to porting SSLRef to
other platforms, read

  - Porting_Notes.txt

If you are developing your own implementation of the SSL 3.0 protocol,
or find you want more specific information about how SSLRef 3.0 works,
you may find useful information in

  - Src_Internals.txt


SSLRef 3.0 License Restrictions
-------------------------------
SSLRef 3.0 is free for non-commercial use. A version is available
for a flat license fee by companies who want to use it in commercial
products. If you have questions about commercial licensing of
