SSLRef 3.0 Final Release
------------------------
* Fixed a bug in src/x509.c when RSAREF is being used: check modulus
& exponent length before copying. Also, fixed a similar problem when
loading private keys in sample/privkey.c.

* Relaxed our requirement on when it's legal to receive a
Certificate Request message; we will now accept one either before or
after the Server Key Exchange message.

* Fixed two minor ordering problems with resuming sessions: we were
sending the server hello message before resuming the session, which
meant we sometimes responded with one cipher suite, but instantiated
another.

* Changed the SSL 2.0 Client Hello parsing code to resume SSL
3.0-encoded cipher suites first, even if they are late in the list,
when we're instantiating an SSL 3 session.

* Fixed some error-case leaks in BSAFE symmetric cipher setup.

* Fixed a memory leak when the CheckCertificate callback returned an
error.

* Fixed a number of memory leaks when disposing of an SSL Context.

* Fixed memory leaking from record structures in src/sslhdshk.c:
SSLPrepareAndQueueMessage.

* Fixed leak of key object in initialization of symmetric ciphers
for BSAFE.

* Leak patched when an error was bubbled up from
SSLProcessProtocolMessage in SSLHandshakeProceed in ssltrspt.c

* Introduced another handshake state, HandshakeChangeCipherSpec, to
protect against an attack pointed out by Bruce Schneier and David
Wagner in which an attacker deletes the change cipher spec message
to keep the protocol stack from transitioning to a negotiated cipher
suite. Now we will not accept a Finished message unless we've
received a change cipher spec; thus, we will not enable data
transfer until we've transitioned to the new spec.

* Fixed bug in sample client's time routine: Mac time adjustment
wasn't properly #ifdef'd.

* Fixed bug in ssl2mesg.c: we now pin the version negotiated to SSL
3.0 when we receive an SSL 2.0 message specifying a higher version
(previously we would have gladly pretended to negotiate SSL 3.1,
4.0, or whatever.)

* Fixed a problem where a peer which sent an empty Certificate
message would cause us to crash by dereferencing a null pointer in a
certificate list.

* SSLClose in ssltrspt.c was being overly aggressive on reporting
SSLIOErr returned by the calls it made when connections closed, even
if they closed gracefully without error. This is corrected.

* Corrected an error in SSLEncodeAlert(); it was incorrectly setting
rec->contents.data[0] = desc.

* Corrected an error in 1024 bit certificate support in x509.c. This
did not affect exportable 512 bit certificate support.

* Month decoding was incorrect in ASNDecodeUTCTime(); dates always
got decoded as one month later than they were.

* Added #include <string.h> to ciphers.c.

* A number of other minor changes


SSLRef 3.0b2 Changes

  Converted all source file names to 8.3:
    Old                 New
    privatekey.c        privkey.c
    SSLTest.c           testssl.c
    SSLTest.h           testssl.h
    TestAlloc.c         testutil.c
    TestDB.c            testdb.c

  Moved from #including verisign.c to linking with it and defining
  its definitions extern.

  Created makefile.w32 to make for Win32 platforms.

  Conditionalized out RC4 support for RSAREF build.

  Removed Diffie-Hellman group generation & storage code; now we use
  pre-defined groups created for SKIP.

  Fixed two bugs with DHanon when using BSAFE.

  Fixed problems in testio.c.

  Added support for specifying hosts as dotted decimal IP addresses.

  Fixed a bug encountered while using BSAFE client authentication.
