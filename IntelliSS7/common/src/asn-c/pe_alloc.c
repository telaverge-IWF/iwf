 * A Presentation Element (or PElement) is an internal representation for
 * a presentation type from ISO8825.  The fields of the structure are:
 *
 *	pe_class:	UNIVersal, APPLication, CONText, or PRIVate
 *	pe_form:	PRIMative, CONStructor, InlineCONStructor
 *	pe_id:		identifier
 *
 *	pe_len:		if a PRIMative, then the length of pe_prim,
 *			else a scratch value; "indefinite" length elements
 *			have a pe_len of -1 (PE_LEN_INDF)
 *	pe_ilen:	if an InlineCONStructor, then the offset to the real
 *			data portion
 *
 *	pe_prim:	if a PRIMative or an Inline CONStructor, the
 *			byte-string
 *	pe_cons:	if a CONStructor, the first element in the
 *			singly-linked list of elements
 *
 *	pe_next:	if the immediate parent is a constructor, the
 *			next element in the singly-linked list of elements
 *
 *	pe_cardinal:	if a LIST (SET or SEQ CONStructor), the cardinality
 *			of the list
 *	pe_offset:	if a member of a SEQ LIST, the offset in the SEQUENCE
 *
 *	pe_nbits:	if a BITSTRING, the number of bits in the string
 *
 *	pe_refcnt:	a hack for ANYs in pepy
