/*
 * ps_alloc.c - allocate a presentation stream
 */

#include <asn-c/AsnC.h>

#ident "$Id: ps_alloc.c,v 9.1 2005/03/23 12:53:04 cvsadmin Exp $"

/* A Presentatation Stream (or PStream) is the second generation of
   "generic" I/O stream-based handling.  (For the first attempt,
   take a look at the prototype implementation of the TTI Trusted Mail
   Agent.)  The idea is to present a common, simple I/O paradigm (i.e.,
   the UNIX v7 philosophy) to protocol-translation entities regardless of
   the underlying medium (files, pipes, sockets, or strings).

   New streams are created by a call to ps_alloc().  It allocates memory
   and calls an open routine.  This routine fills in the dispatch vectors
   for read/write and (optionally) close.  It can also fill in any other
   part of the stream's structure it likes.

   Once created, I/O is done using the macros ps_read/ps_write.  These
   return either NOTOK or OK; depending on how things went. The read/write
   routines are invoked as:

	int	iofunc (ps, data, n, in_line)
	PS	ps;
	PElementData data;
	PElementLen  n;
	int	in_line;

   They should read/write upto len bytes, starting at data, and return the
   number of bytes processed, or NOTOK on error.  The routine ps_io() will
   make successive calls to fill/flush the data.  If the read/write routine
   returns NOTOK, it should set ps_errno as well.

   Streams are removed by a call to ps_free ().  It calls the close
   routine, if any, which should de-commission any parts of the stream's
   structure that are in use.  ps_free() will then free the allocated
   memory.
 */
PS
ps_alloc (OPENFP io)
{
    PS	    ps;

    if ((ps = (PS) calloc (1, sizeof *ps)) == NULL)
    {
        return NULL;
    }
    
    if ((*io)(ps) == NOTOK)
    {
        ps_free (ps);
        
        return NULL;
    }
    
    return ps;
}
