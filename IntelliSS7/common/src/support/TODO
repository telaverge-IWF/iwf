 o Need AIX support.   Never have had an AIX client.
 o Need SGI support?   Never have had an SGI client.
 o Think about IMAL for UDP [specifically this is broken write now
   due to Read/Write extension missing for IMAL UDP].
 o We need to add a KAFIFOTRAN class for keepalives on fifos.  Extra
   work, I know, but it turned out this was easier than adding KA
   behavior to all transports - what would that mean for SS7 and tqueues
   anyway.
 o Think about UNIX domain DATAGRAM sockets.  Should we unlink on open
   here?  Dunno.  Are UNIX domain datagram sockets bidirectional?  See
   about adding domain to EndPointTrans to use this.  Affects SCTP in
   some ways.
 o M2UA and M2PA
 o MGCP, MEGACO, SIP
 o General stack "FIXME"s
 o There is a wide-open race with the MTP3 implementation.  If the
   border transports representing SS7 links (M2PA or MTP2) have not
   started when MTP3 starts, it is possible that TRANSPORT_PutEvent
   will fail, perhaps messily depending on the circumstances.  We
   need a synchronization mechanism to delay MTP3's start until the
   vendor libs are active.  The initial MTP3 start delay accomplishes
   this, but is hardly deterministic.
 o Think about SAAL links - the max msg size goes to 4096.  MTP3 and
   SCCP need to be adjusted appropriately.
