 *****************************************************************************
 *  Interface:
 *      FIFO_*
 *
 *  Purpose:
 *      This interface provides exactly half of the interface needed by
 *      the Fifo class.  In other words, the fifo that a task reads from
 *      is NOT the fifo that other tasks write to.  For IPC, you need two
 *      fifos for bidirectional communication.
 *
 *  Usage:
 *      Depending on the creation mode, a fifo can either be read from,
 *      or written to, but never both.  This follows the general logic for
 *      transports that any task consumes messages from one point, but
 *      can send messages to many points.
 *
 *      Note that the read/write routines do NOT check for whether or not
 *      the fifo created is in read or write mode; it is assumed that the
 *      caller is smart enough to know which is which.  This is another reason
 *      that these interfaces are not intended for general use.
 *
 *      Usage of fifos is as follows:
 *      ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      * for readers *
 *      ITS_FIFO rfifo;
 *
 *      * creation *
 *      if (ITS_CreateFifo(&rfifo, ITS_FIFO_READER) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *      {
 *          * error condition *
 *      }
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      * for writers *
 *      ITS_FIFO wfifo;
 *
 *      * creation *
 *      if (ITS_CreateFifo(&wfifo, ITS_FIFO_WRITER) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *      {
 *          * error condition *
 *      }
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      * which one you use from here on out depends on which side of the
 *      * endpoint you're on.  Senders Write() to ITS_FIFO_WRITER fifos.
 *      * Readers Read() from ITS_FIFO_READER fifos.
 *      if (ITS_WriteFifo(&wfifo, buf, size) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *      {
 *          * error condition *
 *      }
 *
 *      if (ITS_ReadFifo(&rfifo, buf, size) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *      {
 *          * error condition *
 *      }
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      * regardless of the type, the user should destroy any fifos created.
 *      ITS_DeleteFifo(&wfifo);
 *      ITS_DeleteFifo(&rfifo);
 *      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      Again, the reentrancy restrictions of this transport are operating
 *      system dependent.

 *****************************************************************************
 *  Interface:
 *      Fifo
 *
 *  Purpose:
 *      The Fifo interface provides the means for high-speed communication
 *      between processes on a single platform.  It falls mid-way along the
 *      cost/complexity line -- it is heavier than a task queue, but lighter
 *      than sockets.
 *
 *      Fifo(s) aren't intended for use by consumers of IntelliSS7,
 *      although they are available as a convenience.  The methods are not
 *      guaranteed to retain the same signatures in this case.
 *
 *  Usage:
 *      How fifos are implemented is operating system dependent, but the
 *      public interface is the same across platforms.  On those platforms
 *      that do not implement an interprocess message passing mechanism
 *      (e.g., something like mqd_t for Solaris, or CreateNamedPipe() on NT),
 *      the fifo is not guaranteed to be of the minimum possible weight.
 *
 *      Note that while ITS_FIFO represents a bidirectional communications
 *      path, BOTH *endpoints* in a connection need a their own fifo.
 *      This explains why any given Fifo endpoint has two ITS_FIFO objects;
 *      one for sending messages, one for receiving messages.
 *
 *      The usage for fifos is as follows:
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      char pathName = "./local_fifo"; // Note that the rules for fifo names
 *                                      // varies from platform to platform.
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      // you must specify the pathname for the fifo as well as the open mode
 *      Fifo *f = new Fifo(pathName);
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      // the read and write routines are used for passing data
 *      // the return values from these routines are ITS_SUCCESS or error
 *      char buf[ITS_PATH_MAX];
 *      if (f->Read(buf, ITS_PATH_MAX) == ITS_SUCCESS)
 *      {
 *          if (f->Write(buf, nbytes) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *          {
 *              // an error has occurred
 *          }
 *      }
 *      else
 *      {
 *          // an error has occurred.
 *      }
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      // when finished with a fifo, it should be deleted
 *      delete f;
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      For those operating systems whose fifos are implemented as byte
 *      streams, users should use the ITS_GatedFifo to guarantee proper
 *      data serialization.
 *
 *      This code cannot be considered reentrant on all platforms.  Check
 *      its_fifo.h to see if your platform supports reentrant fifos, or
 *      if you need to use gated fifos.
