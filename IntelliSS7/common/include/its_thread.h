 *****************************************************************************
 *  Interface:
 *      THREAD_*
 *
 *  Purpose:
 *      The ITS_THREAD interface defines how IntelliSS7 users interact with
 *      native thread implementations on different operating systems.  The
 *      implementation is portable, so code written on one platform should
 *      be usable on many platforms (with several minor exceptions).
 *
 *      These routines work directly on thread objects, and as such do not
 *      maintain any context information for individual threads, other than
 *      the thread handle.
 *
 *  Usage:
 *      Usage of ITS_THREAD is fairly simple:
 *      ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *      * must have a thread function *
 *      THREAD_RET_TYPE
 *      ThreadFunc(void *arg)
 *      {
 *          ITS_THREAD *thr = (ITS_THREAD *)arg;
 *
 *          printf("foo\n");
 *
 *          ITS_ThreadExit();
 *      }
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      * Create the thread *
 *      ITS_THREAD thr;
 *      if (THREAD_CreateThread(&thr, 0, ThreadFunc, (void *)&thr,
 *                              ITS_TRUE) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *      {
 *          * an error occurred *
 *      }
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      * Threads can be killed, but is VERY STRONGLY discouraged *
 *      THREAD_KillThread(&thr);
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      * Threads can be suspended and resumed *
 *      if (THREAD_ThreadSuspend(&thr) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *      {
 *          * an error has occurred *
 *      }
 *
 *      if (THREAD_ThreadResume(&thr) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *      {
 *          * an error has occurred *
 *      }
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      * and threads can be waited for *
 *      void *status;
 *      if (THREAD_WaitForThread(&thr, &status) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *      {
 *          * an error occurred *
 *      }
 *      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      All thread routines are reentrant and thread safe.

/*.interface:Thread
 *****************************************************************************
 *  Interface:
 *      Thread
 *
 *  Purpose:
 *      The Thread class brings thread support to the IntelliSS7 C++ API.
 *      As with many other classes in the support library, the Thread
 *      class is implemented as a wrapper around the C function counterparts
 *      of each method -- although there are some exceptions to that.
 *
 *      A thread is defined as a thread of execution in a process space.
 *      In traditional multiprocessing systems, each process had a single
 *      thread of execution within the process address space.  Put a different
 *      way, such processes were "single threaded" -- there was only one
 *      sequence of operations as defined by the program logic.
 *
 *      Multithreaded applications introduces the concept of multiple threads
 *      of execution within a single process space.  The scheduling of each
 *      thread can be preemptive or cooperative, just as the scheduling of
 *      processes in a traditional multiprocessing architecture.  Threads
 *      can either be scheduled by the user, or by the operating system kernel,
 *      as the implementation allows.
 *
 *      Multithreading is a very powerful programming tool; it allows a single
 *      application to perform two or more loosely coupled tasks at the same
 *      time.  However, it does complicate *some* programming activities --
 *      specifically those which are associated with communication between
 *      the threads.  The application programmer now has to be familiar with
 *      critical sections, mutual exclusion, race conditions, and deadlock.
 *      In the interest of brevity, those terms will not be explained here;
 *      consult any good operating systems textbook for more information.
 *
 *      IntelliSS7 requires preemptive, kernel scheduled threads for best
 *      execution.  Run-to-completion threads will probably NOT work for
 *      IntelliSS7 (i.e., what MS terms "fibers").
 *
 *  Usage:
 *      The usage for Thread is fairly straightfoward.  Let's start
 *      by examining a typical thread function:
 *      -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      // a thread execution function; deal with WIN32 oddities
 *      THREAD_RET_TYPE
 *      ThreadFunc(void *arg)
 *      {
 *          Thread *thr = (Thread *)arg;
 *
 *          printf("foo\n");
 *
 *          // what's this?  See below
 *          delete thr;
 *
 *          Thread::Exit();
 *      }
 *      -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      That looks a little strange, doesn't it?  We delete the thread
 *      object before the thread returns.
 *
 *      There is a reason for that.  Keep in mind that threads are (usually)
 *      an operating system object; the Thread object only contains
 *      housekeeping information about the thread.  Deleting a thread object
 *      does NOT cause the thread to terminate, it only "schedules" the
 *      thread for removal, but the thread will not be destroyed until
 *      it ceases execution, <I>even though the Thread object no longer
 *      exists</I>.
 *
 *      The method Thread::Exit() is a static method, and thus does not
 *      require a thread object when invoked.  The Thread::Exit() method
 *      causes a thread of execution to actually terminate.  It is possible
 *      just to return from the thread function (which accomplishes the same
 *      effect on most platforms), but it is recommended that the user
 *      call Thread::Exit() instead, for portability reasons.
 *
 *      It is STRONGLY recommended that Thread objects be created using
 *      operator new.  If Thread objects are not created this way,
 *      and the object goes out of scope, the object will no longer be valid;
 *      this can (and will) cause confusion if the Thread object is
 *      passed to the thread function, as the object will be destroyed at
 *      an unknown time.
 *
 *      That's confusing, so let's try an example:
 *      -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      int
 *      foo()
 *      {
 *          Thread thr(0, ThreadFunc);
 *
 *          if (thr.Enter((void *)&thr) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *          {
 *              // an error occurred
 *          }
 *
 *          return (0);
 *      }
 *      -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      Consider: when we enter function foo(), a thread object is allocated
 *      on the stack, and the constructor is called.  The constructor
 *      sets the stack size, and the function to execute.  IT DOES NOT
 *      CREATE THE THREAD.  The Thread method Enter() is where the
 *      thread is actually created.  Once Enter() is invoked, the new thread
 *      begins executing the ThreadFunc -- but in a new thread of execution.
 *      The original thread of execution continues after the call to Enter(),
 *      which means the function foo() will return, <I>thus destroying the
 *      Thread object</I>.  THIS means that the address we passed into
 *      the function is not valid.  The time at which the address becomes
 *      invalid is not defined -- the scheduler determines (according to its
 *      own algorithm) whether the new thread or the original thread executes
 *      first.
 *
 *      The bottom line: DO NOT CREATE THREADS THIS WAY.  The proper way
 *      to create threads is as follows:
 *      -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      int
 *      foo()
 *      {
 *          Thread *thr = new Thread(0, ThreadFunc);
 *
 *          if (thr->Enter((void *)thr) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *          {
 *              // an error occurred
 *          }
 *
 *          return (0);
 *      }
 *      -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      By using operator new, the Thread object is created on the heap,
 *      and will not be affected by the Thread <I>pointer</I> going
 *      out of scope.
 *
 *      Threads can be suspended (pause execution), and resumed (continue
 *      execution) either by themselves or by other threads.  (This behavior
 *      is key to the implementation of thread pools, by the way.  See
 *      <A HREF=its_threadpool.html>ITS_ThreadPool</A>
 *      for details).  For example:
 *      -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      ...
 *          if (thr->Suspend() != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *          {
 *              // an error occurred
 *          }
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *          if (thr->Resume() != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *          {
 *              // an error occurred
 *          }
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      It is *possible* to kill a thread, but is <B><I>very, very strongly
 *      discouraged</I></B>.  The reasons for this are many:
 *          o   A thread may have possession of a mutex when it is destroyed.
 *              The mutex is not automatically released.
 *          o   The thread may be in the process of updating a critical
 *              resource, and the update may only be partially complete.
 *          o   The process may be left in an inconsistent state.
 *      For these reasons (among others), do NOT kill threads unless you
 *      KNOW that nothing bad will happen.  In practice, this means NEVER.
 *
 *      Threads can also be waited on.  This allows a thread to transmit
 *      its exit code to the waiter:
 *      --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      // don't do this
 *      thr->Kill();
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      // but this is ok
 *      void *status;
 *      if (thr->WaitFor(&status) != ITS_SUCCESS)
 *      {
 *          // an error occurred
 *      }
 *      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      For a concrete example, we have included our thread unit test
 *      to give a more accurate example of Thread usage, and how to
 *      subclass from Thread:

 *
 *      This test creates a thousand threads and waits for them all to exit.
 *      The test takes about 7 seconds to run on a SPARC 4 workstation, about
 *      6 seconds on a 333 MHz Pentium Pro.  Note that each thread sleeps
 *      for *5* seconds. time(1) on Solaris indicates 6.2 seconds of real
 *      time, 0.8 seconds of user time, and 0.8 seconds of system time.
 *
 *                              ---------------
 *
 *      Note that a thread waiting for itself to exit (which is about as
 *      useful as contemplating your navel) is considered an error (deadlock).
 *
 *      All thread methods are reentrant.  All Thread methods are thread
 *      safe, with the exception of the constructor.  The result of calling
 *      Thread::Enter() multiple times on the same thread is undefined.
