Former results (all descriptions of ASN.1 types were not static):
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Debug mode:
-----------

- 10000 iterations => 77 s => 7.7 ms for encode / decode cycle.
100% of CPU. No memory leak.

- Profiler:

25% - operator delete(void *)
6.5% - std::_Allocate(int unsigned char*)
5.3% - std::_Allocate(int, char*)
...


Release mode:
-------------

- 10000 iterations => 17 s = > 1.7 ms for encode / decode cycle.
