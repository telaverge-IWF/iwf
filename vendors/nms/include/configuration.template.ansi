 * want to use the richer features of the support library,
 * you can chose STANDALONE.

 * You can use the IntelliNet stack in two ways.  You
 * can either use IntelliNet TCAP, SCCP, ISUP, etc, and
 * just use NMS MTP3 and below, or you can fix it so that
 * all SS7 messaging be done via only NMS APIs.  The first
 * option means that calling TCAP_SendDialogue()s implementation
 * transmits the dialogue through IntelliNet TCAP and SCCP,
 * and calls SS7_PutEvent() on the encoded MTP3 output of
 * SCCP.  The second choice means that TCAP_SendDialogue()
 * is implemented as SS7_PutEvent() directly, and the NMS
 * TCAP API should be used to transmit.  In the second case,
 * you should NOT include the IntelliNet vendor library in
 * your build.  Note that this #define is useless if
 * STANDALONE has been selected; the intent here is to
 * support applications that use the NMS stack, but integrate
 * it as a border transport into a multithreaded application
 * using the support library.  Standalone NMS really implies
 * that the stack is being used in SINGLE_USER mode (o.k.,
 * that really means only one border transport).

 * Uncomment ONE of the following.  NMS cannot interface to
 * multiple layers of the stack simultaneously.  Therefore
