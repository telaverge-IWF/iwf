 ****************************************************************************/
This module named "loopback" gives the user an idea about the xml configuration
needed if we would like to use a loop-back (eg. portA to PortB in nms OR port1
to port2 in sbe,...). Discussion is around the IntelliNet ISUP usage with
Accelero and its Engine.


1. NMS SCENARIO 
   ------------
ftest.xml.nmsA - NMS Port A Channel T1 with SLC 0
ftest.xml.nmsA - NMS Port B Channel T9 with SLC 8

After U align, try mtp2mgr and U should see the following:
mtp2mgr[1]>status link *
Num    Name   MTP2 Hi State    MTP2 Low State
---    ----   -------------    --------------
  0     T1    ENABLED          IN_SERVICE          
  1     T2    CONFIG'D         IDLE                
  2     T3    CONFIG'D         IDLE                
  3     T4    CONFIG'D         IDLE                
  4     T5    CONFIG'D         IDLE                
  5     T6    CONFIG'D         IDLE                
  6     T7    CONFIG'D         IDLE                
  7     T8    CONFIG'D         IDLE                
  8     T9    ENABLED          IN_SERVICE          
  9     T10   CONFIG'D         IDLE                
 10     T11   CONFIG'D         IDLE                
 11     T12   CONFIG'D         IDLE                
 12     T13   CONFIG'D         IDLE                
 13     T14   CONFIG'D         IDLE                
 14     T15   CONFIG'D         IDLE                
 15     T16   CONFIG'D         IDLE                
mtp2mgr[1]>


If U want more links, open up more ports in TDMCp1.cfg and modify the MTP3Cfg with proper SLCs for those channels. Run tdmcfg -i TDMCp1.cfg and ss7load

2. SBE SCENARIO
   ------------
ftest.xml.port0
    <SBE_Data  sectionName = "SBE SS7-1"
                board       = "0"
                port1       = "0"
                TR_TYPE     = "1"
                linkSet_1A     = "1"
                linkCodes_1A   = "0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15"
    />


ftest.xml.port1
    <SBE_Data  sectionName = "SBE SS7-1"
                board       = "0"
                port1       = "1"
                TR_TYPE     = "1"
                linkSet_1A     = "1"
                linkCodes_1A   = "0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15"
    />


Just the port numbers are different. Use the same links in Border Transport both sides
