          Testing IntelliNet ISUP Stack (Load Test)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Building Load Test App :-

   a) Load Test application uses Make file to compile and link
      all the files.

   b)Give make command in this directory.(Please use gnu make
     to build test app).

   c) This will generate libload-intelli3-nms2-ANSID.so librirary and
      load-intelli3-nms2-ANSID  executable in ./nmsmtp2 directory.



2) Configuring the test application configuration(XML) file.

   a) Before running test App you must have to configure the XML file.
      Test App uses xml for storing configuration information.
      It reads config information from this file at time of
      initialization.

   b) Type cd nmsmtp2( change directory to the ./nmsmtp2).
                                               ----------
   c) IntelliNet provides sample XML configuration file.
      Open the file ftest.xml and configure the point codes
      and route information.

   d) The load test app reads the load configuration from the
      load.ini file located in the same direcotry.In this file
      you can specify how many calls per/sec you want generate.

NOTE:    If you do not want change the default config
         The defualt file is configured for LOCAL PC 0x10
         REMOTE PC  0x15 and LinkSet 1 and 
         Link code 0,1,2 and 3 for running load test.
         This is the information to configure other Node.

3) Running Load Test App :-

   a)Change the directory to nmsmtp2 if you are not already there.
   b)Make sure you have ftest-intelli3-nms2-ANSID executable
     and libftest-intelli3-nms2-ANSID.so librarie in the directory.

     Type  ./load-intelli3-nms2-ANSID and press Enter.

  c)  After starting your test application, start the Debug client
      if you not already started (Please see (4) how to start Debug client).

  d)  Then on command prompt type start ,Then IntelliMTP3 will start the
       alignment of the links.(see EXAMPLE 1)

  e)  After alignment of links is completed,
      Load test application is ready to generate load.


NOTE: Load test App is only load generator,It generates IAM messages,
      and Wait for ACM , ANM and REL msg from other side.After receiing
      REL from remote it acknowledge with RLC.


4) Running the Debug client console

   a) Debug client is located in bin directory.
   b) Change you derectory to bin.
   c) Type ./DBGConsole -socket and press enter.
   d) This will give command prompt >>.
   e) Type ? to see all the commands that are avialable
      (see exaple 2).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE 1:

   On the Debug client command prompt type.

command: >> start

Result :    IntelliMTP3 starts the aligment of links.

EXAMPLE 2:

command: >> ?

Result :    Prints the all available commands.

EXAMPLE 3:

command: >> statRSC 

Result :    Starts the reseting all the cics configured.


EXAMPLE 4:

command: >> startIAM starts sending IAM messages.

Result :    Prints the circuit state of the circuit code 1.
