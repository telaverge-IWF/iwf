# GCS Daemon should work fine on one machine with just the uncommented

# more complex network setups.

# This configures one GCS Daemon running on port 4803 on localhost.

# GCS Daemon options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Set what internal GCS Daemon events are logged to the screen or file 
# (see EventLogFile).
# Default setting is to enable PRINT and EXIT events only. 
#The PRINT and EXIT types should always be enabled. The names of others are:
#    	EXIT PRINT DEBUG DATA_LINK NETWORK PROTOCOL SESSION 
#	CONFIGURATION MEMBERSHIP FLOW_CONTROL STATUS EVENTS 
#	GROUPS MEMORY SKIPLIST ALL NONE	
#    ALL and NONE are special and represent either enabling every type 
#                                           or enabling none of them.
#    You can also use a "!" sign to negate a type, 
#        so { ALL !DATA_LINK } means log all events except data_link ones.

#DebugFlags = { PRINT EXIT }

#Set whether to log to a file as opposed to stdout/stderr and what 
# file to log to.
# Default is to log to stdout.
#
#If option is not set then logging is to stdout.
#If option is set then logging is to the filename specified.
# The filename can include a %h or %H escape that will be replaced at runtime
# by the hostname of the machine upon which the daemon is running.
# For example "EventLogFile = gcs_daemon_log_%h.log" with 2 machines 
# running GCS Daemon (machine1.mydomain.com and machine2.mydomain.com) will
# cause the daemons to log to "gcs_daemon_log_machine1.mydomain.com.log" and
# "gcs_daemon_log_machine2.mydomain.com.log" respectively.

#EventLogFile = testlog.out

#Set whether to add a timestamp in front of all logged events or not.
# Default is no timestamps. Default format is "[%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S]".
#If option is commented out then no timestamp is added.
#If option is enabled then a timestamp is added with the default format
#If option is enabled and set equal to a string, then that string is used
#   as the format string for the timestamp. The string must be a valid time
#   format string as used by the strftime() function.

#EventTimeStamp
# or
#EventTimeStamp = "[%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S]"

#Set whether to allow dangerous monitor commands 
# like "partition, flow_control, or kill"
# Default setting is FALSE.
#If option is set to false then only "safe" monitor commands are allowed 
#    (such as requesting a status update).
#If option is set to true then all monitor commands are enabled. 
#   THIS IS A SECURTIY RISK IF YOUR NETWORK IS NOT PROTECTED!

#DangerousMonitor = false

#Set the list of authentication methods that the daemon will allow
# and those which are required in all cases.
# All of the methods listed in "RequiredAuthMethods" will be checked,
# irregardless of what methods the client chooses.
# Of the methods listed is "AllowedAuthMethods" the client is
# permitted to choose one or more, and all the ones the client chooses
# will also be checked.
#
# To support older clients, if NULL is enabled, then older clients can
# connect without any authentication. Any methods which do not require
# any interaction with the client (such as IP) can also be enabled
# for older clients. If you enable methods that require interaction,
# then essentially all older clients will be locked out.
#
#The current choices are:
#	NULL for default, allow anyone authentication
#	IP for IP based checks using the gcs_daemon_ip_access file

#RequiredAuthMethods = "   "
#AllowedAuthMethods = "NULL"

#Set the current access control policy.
# This is only needed if you want to establish a customized policy.
# The default policy is to allow any actions by authenticated clients.
#AccessControlPolicy = "PERMIT"

# Gcs Daemon will feel free to use broadcast messages within a sub-network.
# if you do not want this to happen, you should specify your machines on
# different logical sub-networks.

# IP-Multicast addresses can also be used as the multicast address for
# the logical sub-network as in this example. If IP-multicast is supported
# by the operating system, then the messages will only be received
# by those machines who are in the group and not by all others in the same
# sub-network as happens with broadcast addresses
