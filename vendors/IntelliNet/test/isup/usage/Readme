This module shows some of the IntelliNet ISUP APIs and their usage.

*** "Intention is to show the usage of IntelliNet ISUP APIs only."

This application is 'not completely written' to fit into Accelero. So don't try to run the application coz you will see Engine related errors for missing libraries.

To have a feel of ISUP in action, please refer to our isup test applications.
