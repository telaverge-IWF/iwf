  Testing IntelliNet ISUP Stack (functional test)
-------------------------------------------------

1) Building functional Test App :-

   a) Test application uses Make file to compile and link
      all the files.
   b)Give make command in this directory.(Please use gnu make   
     to build test app).
   c) This will generate libriraries and executable in ./nmsmtp2 directory.

    
2) Configuring the test application configuration(XML) file.

   a) Before running test App you must have to configure the XML file.
      Test App uses xml for storing configuration information.
      It reads config information from this file at time of
      initialization.

   b) Type cd nmsmtp2( change directory to the ./nmsmtp2).
                                               ----------
   c) IntelliNet provides sample XML configuration file. 
      Open the file ftest.xml and configure the point codes 
      and route information.

   d) The file ansi_msg.txt contains the Messages codes.
      You can define the Parameters and their values for
      each msg here.The Test application reads Msg codes,
      Parameter code and values for that parameters, when
      command is executed throgh Debug Client.

NOTE:    If you do not want change the default config 

         The defualt file is configured for LOCAL PC 0x10
         REMOTE PC  0x15 and LinkSet 1 and Link code 0.
         This is the information to configure other Node.

NOTE:
      Every msg in the ansi_msg.txt file includes routing label
      also, so if you chamge the point codes you will have to
      change here also. 

3) Running Test App :-

   a)Change the directory to nmsmtp2 if you are not already there.
   b)Make sure you have ftest-intelli3-nms2-ANSID executable 
     and libftest-intelli3-nms2-ANSID.so librarie in the directory.
      
     Type  ./ftest-intelli3-nms2-ANSID and press Enter.

  c)  After starting your test application, start the Debug client
      if you not already started (Please see (4) how to start Debug client).

  d)  Then on command prompt type start ,Then IntelliMTP3 will start the
       alignment of the links.(see EXAMPLE 1)

  e)  After alignment of links is completed,
    test application is ready to accept commands.



NOTE:- Please make sure that you have excecuted start command first to 
       aling the links (3.d). 

NOTE:- 
   Functional test application is interactive one,it is to test only
   the ISUP stack ,application doesn't maintain any internal state machine.

4) Running the Debug client console 

   a) Debug client is located in bin directory.
   b) Change you derectory to bin.
   c) Type ./DBGConsole -socket and press enter. 
   d) This will give command prompt >>.
   e) Type ? to see all the commands that are avialable
      (see exaple 2).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE 1:

   On the Debug client command prompt type.

command: >> start

Result :    IntelliMTP3 starts the aligment of links.

EXAMPLE 2:

command: >> ?

Result :    Prints the all available commands.

EXAMPLE 3:

command: >> iam 1 

Result :    Application will sends IAM msg on circuit code 1 to stack.


EXAMPLE 4:

command: >> cic 1

Result :    Prints the circuit state of the circuit code 1.
