ISUP General Note 1:
In C_ISUP: CIC has been replaced by Global Call Reference (GCR).
GCR is over 8 bytes while CIC is over two bytes.
For current dev. assuming that size of GCR is the same size as the CIC.

ISUP General Note 2:
In The ISUP library:
ISUP_MessageSanityCheck_CCITT:
Currently I use the description to check if params are present.
The description should follow the variant description for the msg.
If we do not find the param: I return an Error: ITS_BADISUPMESSAGE.
This behavior is not 100% correct because of the "param compatibility"
parameter. We are allowed to forward a param that we do not know.

Note 2:
Timers Definition for T5
	Even though ITU Q.764 specs says that T5 is between 5-15 minutes, it seems
	common that the default value is 1 minute.

Note 3:
CPC_OGCAnsState5_CCITT() and CPC_ICCAnsState6_CCIIT() and other state: 
RLC msg:
	I am not quit sure if we should forward the RLC to the application. Simply
	because: Excel will send a "cause failure PPL event Indication" (this is
	not a RLC), and Newnet stack delivers a "CALL_FAILURE primitive". But
	(at least for now) in our case we are NOT flexible at all (ISUP msg or
	nothing else), so for now CPC forwards the RLC message to the APP.

Note 4
CPC_IdleState0_CCITT():
IAM msg from SPRC:
	Checking Xl SDL, the first thing they seems to check is the congestion.
	Can we do that in our stuff. In other words: from RUDP or MTP3, does
	the Transport will send us this kind of information (as en event,
	CallBacks, others ...) ???? For now, we do not check the Congestion,
	since I do not know how to check it.

Note 5
CPC_IdleState0_CCITT():
IAM msg from APP: Do we need to check for Test Call?? Did not find it in XL
                  CPC SDL.

Note 6:
Unexpected Msg for State: 
	if a msg is unexpected for a state (assuming this is not a bug in ITS ISUP
	stack). ITU Q.764 and XL reset the circuit. This is nice, but how about 
	C-ISUP. For now do nothing. 

Note 7:
__ISUP_IsMsgCallControlMsg_CCITT: 
	I am not quite sure if those msgs are call related or not (but for C-ISUP
	it is ok since not supported):
	ISUP_MSG_FOT /* Forward Transfer */
	ISUP_MSG_LPA /* LoopBack Ack */

Note 8: 
CPC_WaitForACMState1_CCITT:
SAM msg:
	From XL SDL: app must let know stack that app is expecting SAM, so
	stack can start T35. Once stack receives SAM from SPRC, it disable T35.
	Nothing about that from Newnet (even though in their Timer table, they
	"support" T35). Q.764 (2.2.5) is talking about end-of-pulsing signal (ST).
	I would assume that T35 is not valid for C-ISUP ?????
	Still waiting to hear from Cisco BTW !!!

Note 9:
mutiple states (except wait for RLC):
Received RLC:
	When we receive a RLC from SRC, we send a "call failure" (no true but...)
    indication to APP, then send a REL to SPRC. What about if we receive RLC
	from APP (which I do not handle by the way): forward it to SPRC (but 
	what is the state of Call ???) or "convert" it into REL with cause: call
	failure ???? XL SDL: does not make diff because CPC receives a RELEASE
	REQUEST from APP (maybe L3P or L4 layer changes the request or SDL says:
	"Do not handle this case")



Note 1 (Fixed):
CPC_OGCAnsState6_CCIIT() and CPC_ICCAnsState_CCIIT(): 
PAM Msg:
	If PAM msg is from application: Excel checks if PAM is allowed.
	If PAM is not allowed, PAM will not forward to SPRC.
	What does that mean ??
	Checking Newnet manual (ISUP CCITT): PAM can be sent in backward
	direction as soon as physical connection between two endpoints is
	established. Then PAM can be sent in both directions.
	Was not able to find information in ITU Q.76x.
	For now assuming we can forward PAM from app to SPRC.
	Fix: Forget Newnet.  When receiving IAM, There is a PAM method
	  available/not available indicator in fwd indicators.
