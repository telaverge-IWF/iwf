  Running IntelliNet ISUP server
  -------------------------------------------------

1) Configuring the ISUP server configuration(XML) file.

   a) Before running ISUP server you must have to configure the XML file.
      ISUP server uses xml for storing configuration information.
      It reads config information from this file at time of
      initialization.

   b) Type cd ./etc (change directory to the ./etc) this directory
      contains config files required to run ISUP server.
                                               

   c) IntelliNet provides sample XML configuration file. 
      Open the file Server.xml and configure the point codes 
      and route information.

   d) Configuring Iterative Server Socket:
      -----------------------------------
          Iterative server socket accepts multiple connection request
      request from the client application. Configure Ipaddress 
      and the port number of the local host machine of the server. 
      It is this ipaddress and the port number user has to configure
      while running the ISUP Client application.

NOTE: These IP address and port number will be used by client
      applications to connect to the server.

   e) Configuring SCTP border transport :
      ----------------------------------
         SCTP Border transport will have modifier value as SCTP . 
      Configure the ipaddress and port of the local machine in that 
      section. User has to associate the ASP with SG by specifying the 
      transport name in Associate value field. In this associated 
      transport specify ipaddress and the port number of the SG that 
      is configured. 
          
NOTE:    If you do not want change the default routing config 
         The default file is configured for LOCAL PC 0x10
         REMOTE PC  0x15 and LinkSet 1 and Link code 0 and
         routing key is 0x01.
         This information useful to configure other Node.

    f) Configuring ISUP Destination :
       ----------------------------
       User have to configure ISUP Destination section in the isupServer.xml
       file. User has to configure variant type, destination point code and
       local point code. To learn more about ISUP config please refer to
       the IntelliNet ISUP API USER guide.
