where all tools needed (viz. Xerces, Ace, Boost, OpenDiameter)
are kept.
Ex: export IMS_TOOLS=$HOME/cvsroot/imstools

XERCESCROOT: Env Variable pointing to the xerces base directory
Ex: export XERCESCROOT=$IMS_TOOLS/tools/xerces-c-src_2_7_0

ACE_ROOT: Env Variable pointing to the ACE toolkit base directory
Ex: export ACE_ROOT=$IMS_TOOLS/tools/ACE_wrappers

BOOST_ROOT: Env Variable pointing to the BOOST toolkit base directory
Ex: export BOOST_ROOT=$IMS_TOOLS/tools/boost_1_33_1

DIAMETER_ROOT:  Env Variable pointing to the Open Diameter base directory
Ex: export DIAMETER_ROOT=$IMS_TOOLS/vendors/opendiameter-1.0.7-g

PLATFORM: Environment Variable based on the type of the system.
solaris or linux

LD_LIBRARY_PATH can include the following paths.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$XERCESCROOT/lib:$ACE_ROOT/build/ace/.libs
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$IMS_ROOT/api/c++/lib
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$IMS_ROOT/val/c++/lib
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$IMS_ROOT/vendors/IntelliNet/lib

On ES3.0

the include file for kerberos in  
/usr/kerberos/include instead of /usr/include

Solution: 
-------- 
1. Make sure you have the krb5-devel and krb5-libs rpms installed.
2. Create Symlink for the following files as follows:


    ln -s /usr/kerberos/include/com_err.h /usr/include/ 
    ln -s /usr/kerberos/include/profile.h /usr/include/
    ln -s /usr/kerberos/include/krb5.h /usr/include/

Solaris 10:

I have been able to succesfully build Open Diameter
on solaris 10.

SunOS magoo 5.10 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10

gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 3.4.3 (csl-sol210-3_4-branch+sol_rpath)
(Preinstalled gcc when you install solaris 10 with
the dev. Packages: NOTE; it's installed in /usr/sfw/bin)

make --version GNU Make 3.80

I have followed steps provided by Jean-Francois Bertrand
on the OD Wiki to the tee.

Just minor updates specifically for Solaris 10:

On Solaris 10 the libstdc++.la in /usr/sfw/lib and
/usr/sfw/lib/64 are empty by default (weird..)

Please copy them from the local directory to
/usr/sfw directories mentioned above.

Or download it from the following site:
http://forum.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=22817

You would also need to setup a soft link to libACE_SSL.a
in the ACE_wrappers/ACE directory
     ln -s SSL/libACE_SSL.a libACE_SSL.a
