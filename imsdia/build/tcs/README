DiaMAG - Diameter Messaging API Generator

DiaMAG is a Diameter C++ API generator. It is implemented
as a pure J2SE application.


Build DiaMAG
============


0. Make sure J2SE 1.5 SDK is installed and the SDK tools are available from the
   command prompt.

   You will also need GNU make 3.80, which has been available since 2002.

   A copy of SableCC 3.2, a Java compiler compiler that DiaMAG uses, is
   maintained in 'diameter/mag/bin' so there is no need to install this tool
   separately.

Use of DiaMAG
=============


Input and other settings to DiaMAG are specified on the command-line.
Typing the following command-line shows the usage of this generator.

    % java -jar diameter/mag/bin/diamag.jar
    Usage: java -jar diamag.jar COMMANDS PROTOCOL1 PROTOCOL2 ...
      where COMMANDS can be any combination of
        --c++:SOURCE-ROOT

--c++:SOURCE-ROOT

    This action asks DiaMAG to generate C++ API classes for the given Diameter
    protocols into the named directories. If SOURCE-ROOT doesn't exist, DiaMAG
    will try to create it. DiaMAG will place header files into
    SOURCE-ROOT/include and source files into SOURCE-ROOT/src. Test program
    templates will be placed into SOURCE-ROOT/test.

Protocol Specifications
=======================


The protocol specification we use as input to DiaMAG is based on the same ABNF
notation used by Diameter RFC texts. This format is chosen so that it is a
very simple task to write a specification from the RFC text of a Diameter
application.

Also, each individual Diameter application protocol is to be defined in a
separate protocol specification file. AVPs referenced but already defined in
other protocols should not be redefined.

For a formal definition of this input format, read

    diameter/mag/src/diameter.sablecc

For a good example of a protocol specification, read

    diameter/mag/protocols/rfc3588.protocol


Syntax Check List

  - The specification is case-sensitive
  - Namespace shall match the protocol. For examples, use diameter.cxdx for
    Cx-Dx, and diameter.sh for Sh
  - "::=" is a single token; no spaces shall appear within
  - AVP names and command names shall NOT be enclosed between < and >
  - All fixed AVPs shall appear before other AVPs, and all required AVPs shall
    appear before optional AVPs


Semantic Check List

  - All Enumerated AVP types must have its enumerated values defined
  - All Grouped AVP types must have its contents defined


Protocol Dependency
===================


Protocols with dependency between them shall be provided to DiaMAG at the same
time so that cross references can be resolved. This means all Diameter
application protocols shall be provided to DiaMAG along with the base protocol.
A dependant protocol shall always follow the protocols on which it depends on
the command line.

This may cause the same API (in particular, the base protocol API) to be
generated again and again. This is a waste but fortunately not necessary a
problem, and will be addressed in a future release of DiaMAG.


Usage Examples
==============

To generate the C++ API into api/c++ directory for the Cx/Dx interfaces,

    % java -jar diameter/mag/bin/diamag.jar \
      --c++:api/c++/include%api/c++/src rfc3588.protocol cxdx.protocol

(Note: the above command should be entered as a single line)
